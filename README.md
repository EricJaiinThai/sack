sack
==========

Identify connection of sessions for social engineering attacks.

==========
It is the first framework to keep track of victims through social support live attacks.

```
Example of use: python sack.py
```
* You must be in mode root to run.
* Has support to developing simple of modules
* Something that not can forget (stats.html) here you see the statistics of follow-up of your victims.

This tool was created by the inspiration of love, although the process was chaotic. I told the DragonJAR Security Conference 2016 in colombia and the DurivaCON in mexico.

* You like to monitor to your victims? with sack can
* Would you like to make phishing attacks? with sack can

#### Warning
This was created for educational purposes, I am not responsible for all the things that make the users in the world with Sack.

## Happy hacking!
